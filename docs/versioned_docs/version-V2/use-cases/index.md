(from the Overview)

- allows Ethereum users to prove their membership of a set which they had previously joined without revealing their original identity. 
- allows users to signal their endorsement of an arbitrary string.


## Onchain privacy use cases

- private voting
- whistleblowing
- mixers
- anonymous authentication

## Safety, security features

- prevents double-signalling
- prevents double-spending


Semaphore provides the following features:

1. Generate offchain identities and add them to a Merkle tree (offchain or onchain).
2. Anonymously broadcast a signal onchain, if and only if the identity of the owner belongs to a
   valid Merkle tree and if the nullifier has not already been used.
