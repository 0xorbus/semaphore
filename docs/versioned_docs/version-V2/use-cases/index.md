(from the Overview)

allows Ethereum users to prove their membership of a set which they had previously joined without revealing their original identity. At the same time, it allows users to signal their endorsement of an arbitrary string.
Use cases include private voting, whistleblowing, mixers, and anonymous authentication. Finally, it provides a simple built-in mechanism to prevent double-signalling or double-spending.

## Onchain privacy use cases

- private voting
- whistleblowing
- mixers
- anonymous authentication

## Safety, security features

- prevents double-signalling
- prevents double-spending


Semaphore provides the following features:

1. Generate offchain identities and add them to a Merkle tree (offchain or onchain).
2. Anonymously broadcast a signal onchain, if and only if the identity of the owner belongs to a
   valid Merkle tree and if the nullifier has not already been used.
